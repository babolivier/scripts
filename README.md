# Utility scripts

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is simply a collection of small utility scripts that I have needed at a given time to help me with some random task.

Please note that while I have done my best to make the code nice to read and well commented, most of what ends up in here is stuff that I use either very rarely, or even just once, so I'm unlikely to invest much time in maintaining any of it - and it might not be the best code that you will ever look at. However, please feel free to grab what you need, as long as you comply with the [license](/LICENSE) if you wish to redistribute my work.
